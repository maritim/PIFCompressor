/*
 * This version of Singleton combines the versions of multiple
 * authors to construct the most stable Singleton that I find
 * on the web.
 *
 * The common version is to use the Curiously Recurring 
 * Template Pattern (CRTP). Source: 
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiously_recurring_template_pattern
 *
 * Scott Meyers version of Singleton.
 * Scott Meyers in his Effective C++ book adds a slightly improved 
 * version and in the getInstance() method returns a reference 
 * instead of a pointer. So the pointer final deleting problem disappears.
 * One advantage of this solution is that the function-static object is 
 * initialized when the control flow is first passing its definition.
 *
 * Andrei Alexandrescu's version of Singleton.
 * Phoenix version of Singleton which revive if needed. One such
 * situation would happen when a singleton::instance is called
 * after the singleton was already destroyed before. This could
 * happen for multiple reasons, some are strange class management or
 * (and worse) compiler destruction order. 
 *
 * This singleton implementation was not thread-safe until the C++ 11 
 * standard. In C++11 the thread-safety initialization and destruction 
 * is enforced in the standard. 
 * 
 * Thomas Badie version take advantage of std::forward to forward
 * arguments to the singleton. In this way the Singleton class
 * is as generic as possible.
